# PolkadotJS

## Interact

Once your node is running, go to PolkadotJS interface at [https://polkadot.js.org/apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps). PolkadotJS interface provides an interface for interacting with your node. You can explore the produced blocks, query the chain storage, submit extrinsics, etc. In this section we will explore various ways to interact with your runtime.

## Insert Aura keys

One other option to insert your Aura keys is using PolkadotJS:

Fill out the necessary fields and submit the `rpc` call.
