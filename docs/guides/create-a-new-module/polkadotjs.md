# PolkadotJs

### Query storage

Run the PolkadotJs in previous guides and open the **Chain State** section of the **Developer** tab. You should see something similar to this:

![Picture 1. Chain state](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-04-01-at-16.47.08.png)

We can query the chain, but it will be empty.

### Extrinsics

In the same Developer tab switch to **Extrinsics** section. Pick **`Nicks`** module and select the **`set_name`** extrinsic:

Submit the extrinsic and see if the extrinsic is approved. You can also go back to the **Chain State** section and query the storage for the above account.
