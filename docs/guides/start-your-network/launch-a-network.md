# Launch a Network

### Introduction

Before we generate our keys and edit our chain spec files, we need to launch a network for two participants: **Alice** and **Bob**.

### Alice

The prerequisite for this step is a compiled runtime and generated chain spec file. Refer to [**Development**](../../development/development.md) section or to [previous](../create-your-first-subsembly-runtime/) guide on how to do it.

Alice runs the following commands inside the **Subsembly** project root folder:

```text
make run-node NAME=node01 PORT=30333 WS-PORT=9944 RPC-PORT=9933 spec=raw-chain-spec.json OTHER=--validator
```

What do those flags represent?

```text
NAME= Specifies the name of your Node
PORT = Specifies the port that your node will listen for p2p traffic on
WS-PORT = Specifies the port that your node will listen for p2p traffic on
RPC-PORT = Specifies the port that your node will listen for incoming RPC traffic on
spec = Specifies path to the raw chain spec file
OTHER = Specifies additional flags/options to provide to the node. In this case, we want our node to be validator
```

More details about the flags and other options for the node, can be explored with the following command:

```text
make run-node help=1
```

After running the last command, you should see the following output:
