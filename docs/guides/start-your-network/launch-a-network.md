# Launch a Network

## Introduction

Before we generate our keys and edit the chain spec files, we need are going to launch a network of two nodes: **Alice** and **Bob**.

## Alice Starts the Node

The prerequisite for this step is a compiled runtime and generated chain spec file. Refer to [**Development**](../../development/development.md) section or to [previous](../create-your-first-subsembly-runtime/) guide on how to do it.

Alice runs the following commands inside the **Subsembly** project root folder:

```text
make run-node \
NAME=node01 \
PORT=30333 \
WS-PORT=9944 \
RPC-PORT=9933 \
spec=raw-chain-spec.json \
-- --validator
```

What do those flags represent?

```text
NAME= Specifies the name of your Node
PORT = Specifies the port that your node will listen for p2p traffic on
WS-PORT = Specifies the port that your node will listen for p2p traffic on
RPC-PORT = Specifies the port that your node will listen for incoming RPC traffic on
spec = Specifies path to the raw chain spec file
OTHER = Specifies additional flags/options to provide to the node. In this case, we want our node to be validator
```

More details about the flags and other options for the node, can be explored with the following command:

```text
make run-node help=1
```

After running the last command, you should see the following output:

```

We copy Alice's node identity to use it when we are connecting other nodes to Alice's:

```text
Mar 25 16:11:41.726  INFO üè∑  Local node identity is: 12D3KooWGtgEa8AuxLMnuKf71qE1bPb2nGKXbgmyjhC5G1w7Yrrf (legacy representation: 12D3KooWGtgEa8AuxLMnuKf71qE1bPb2nGKXbgmyjhC5G1w7Yrrf)
```

## Connect to PolkadotJs

Once your node is running, go to PolkadotJS interface at [https://polkadot.js.org/apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps). PolkadotJS interface provides an interface for interacting with your node and it should automatically connect to your local node:

## Bob Joins

In a separate terminal, run the node for Bob:

```text
make run-node \
PORT=30334 \
WS-PORT=9945 \
RPC-PORT=9934 \
spec=raw-chain-spec.json \
NAME=node02 \
-- --validator \
--bootnodes /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/30333/p2p/12D3KooWEyoppNCUx8Yx66oV9fJnriXwCcXwDDUA2kj6vnc6iDEp
```

We can notice some differences compared to the command used to run Alice's node. We changed the ports and name of the node, since two nodes can not have the same name and one port can not be exposed from two different nodes.

Most importantly, we added a **`--bootnodes`** flag, to specify a single boot node of Alice. Here, the value of **`--bootnodes`** flag is comprised of following properties:

* Alice's IP Address, localhost or `127.0.0.1`
* Alice's Port, she specified `30333`
* Alice's Peer ID, we copied it in the Alice's section

After running the command you should see the output similar to this:

```

As you see from the output \(**`1 peers`**\), Bob successfully connected to the Alice's node:

```text
Mar 31 14:06:56.190  INFO üí§ Idle (1 peers), best: #0 (0xc122‚Ä¶3dac), finalized #0 (0xc122‚Ä¶3dac), ‚¨á 1.0kiB/s ‚¨Ü 1.0kiB/s
```

You can also connect this node to PolkadotJs interface. To do that, you will need to change the **`ws`** port in the left tab in the main page \(`9945` in this case\)
