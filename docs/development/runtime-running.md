# Runtime Execution

### Prerequisites

This section assumes that you have already initialised new **Subsembly** project and have generated the chain specification file. And also have converted the chain specification file into raw.

### Run with Substrate Node

Eventually, our aim is to be able to run **Substrate** node with compiled **Subsembly** that is placed in the chain specification file. This is currently work in progress. But for running **Subsembly** runtimes with customised Substrate node, please refer to [guides](../guides/create-your-first-subsembly-runtime/).
